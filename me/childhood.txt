I was born and raised in Stockholm, Sweden, where I have lived my entire life. From a young age, I was fascinated by how things worked — whether it was dismantling old gadgets or trying to improve small household systems. That early curiosity evolved into a lasting passion for building, improving, and understanding processes in depth.

While other kids were outside playing, I often found myself deeply focused on mastering whatever topic caught my interest. Once something intrigued me, I couldn’t let it go until I fully understood it. Some might call that stubbornness — I prefer to see it as determination and grit. That mindset has followed me ever since and continues to define how I approach challenges today.

Growing up in a family that valued hard work and creativity, I learned the importance of discipline, consistency, and perseverance early on. Watching my parents work hard as young parents instilled in me two values that remain at the core of who I am: family and hard work. These lessons have shaped both my personal and professional outlook.

Another defining part of my upbringing was travel. My family and I often explored new countries, which sparked my fascination with cultures, people, and new environments. That exposure gave me a sense of curiosity about the world and a comfort with the unknown. To this day, I keep travel and exploration as lifelong goals — I’m always up for an adventure, even if I don’t know exactly where it will lead.
