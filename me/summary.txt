I’m a naturally curious and creative person with a deep passion for building and improving things. Whether it’s optimizing complex systems, restoring old furniture, or developing AI automations from scratch, I’ve always been driven by a desire to understand how things work and how they can be made better. That curiosity has guided me throughout my journey — from early entrepreneurial ventures to my current role as a Business Analyst at Etraveli Group, where I work with large-scale data and AI systems to enhance our flight search and automation capabilities.

I hold a Master’s degree in Business Administration, which has strengthened my strategic mindset and ability to connect business challenges with technical innovation. What sets me apart is the combination of analytical thinking, creativity, and persistence — I approach every project with the mindset of a builder: learn deeply, think differently, and create solutions that make an impact. I’m constantly exploring new technologies, taking advanced courses in AI automation, and developing projects that push the boundaries of what’s possible.

At my core, I’m someone who loves to build — systems, ideas, and opportunities — and I’m always driven by the question: how can this be done better?
