Looking ahead, my goal is to continue advancing my analytical and AI capabilities. I am genuinely fascinated by the potential of artificial intelligence — it combines two of my greatest passions: building and creating. I plan to keep deepening my expertise by taking courses in agentic AI and AI automation, while continuously developing new projects that challenge me to apply these technologies in practical, impactful ways.

In the long term, I want to keep nurturing my curiosity and creativity — exploring new ideas, experimenting with emerging technologies, and thinking beyond conventional boundaries. My ambition is to work at the intersection of data, automation, and innovation, where I can build solutions that make complex systems simpler and smarter.
