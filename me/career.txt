Throughout my career, I have pursued a variety of roles and entrepreneurial ventures that have developed my analytical mindset, leadership ability, and business acumen.

My journey began in my early teenage years when I started my first side business importing high-quality watches at low cost and selling them through an Instagram account. Within a short time, I built a loyal following and consistent sales. This experience gave me my first exposure to running a business — understanding customers, managing unit economics, and calculating profit margins.

During high school, I began working at a restaurant, initially delivering food before being promoted to team leader due to my reliability and organizational skills. In that role, I learned how to coordinate teams, delegate tasks effectively, and motivate others to work toward a shared goal.

While studying at university, I joined Muji, a Japanese retail company, as a Sales Associate. There, I honed my customer communication and sales skills while leading several in-store initiatives that required attention to detail and strong project coordination.

Around the same time, I discovered an opportunity in furniture restoration after seeing a video online. I bought old, worn-out furniture, restored it, and resold it with significant value added. My first piece sold within 15 minutes, and what began as an experiment quickly grew into a profitable solo business. This experience taught me discipline, end-to-end business management, and the creativity to identify and act on market opportunities.

Today, I work as a Business Analyst at Etraveli Group, one of the world’s leading technology providers in the flight OTA industry, serving over 40 million customers across 75+ markets. In this role, I work with complex backend systems and large-scale data to optimize flight search and content performance. I lead analytical projects that identify inefficiencies and improve system outputs. Additionally, I have taken initiative in driving AI-focused projects — most recently developing an agentic AI system that enables employees to interact with our global flight search platform through natural language, automating technical queries and improving accessibility across teams.
